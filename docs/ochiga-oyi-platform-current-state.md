## 6. Data Flow

High-level flow:

1. Estates, buildings, homes, devices, cameras, residents, wallets, visitors, support, community, and documents originate from Facility OS, Consumer OS, backend services, Edge Agent, and integrations.
2. Shared contracts normalize those records.
3. Unified auth and permissions decide who can read, write, control, or supervise each action.
4. Storage metadata records all production files.
5. Audit records every sensitive action.
6. Realtime events broadcast operational changes.
7. Ochiga Office OS supervises the full ecosystem.
8. Oyi AI can use permitted data to explain, route, open views, and eventually execute controlled actions.

## 7. Current Production Readiness

Approximate readiness by layer:

- Ochiga Office OS: 75% production foundation, 45% full operational product.
- Backend: 80% production foundation, 55% full platform operations.
- Oyi Facility OS: 65% production foundation, 45% full product maturity.
- Oyi Consumer OS: 65% production foundation, 45% full product maturity.
- Oyi Edge Agent: 60% production foundation, 35% live hardware maturity.
- Oyi Digital Twin: 40% production foundation, 20% live twin maturity.
- Oyi Plan Studio: 40% production foundation, 20% full product maturity.
- Oyi AI / Widget: 45% production foundation, 25% full agentic command maturity.
- Websites: 55% production foundation, 35% polished conversion maturity.

## 8. Tier 2 Direction

Tier 2 starts after Tier 1 foundation and focuses on operational product depth.

The first Tier 2 module is the **Ochiga Office Live Infrastructure View**.

Purpose:

- Replace the old static infrastructure health map with a live operational viewport.
- Combine Google Maps, Oyi Digital Twin, hybrid visualization, heat maps, overlays, layer controls, filters, estate health, and route-aware action buttons.
- React to realtime events from Office SSE and backend Socket.IO naming.
- Become the central infrastructure supervision canvas inside Ochiga Office OS.

Tier 2 must build on Tier 1 rules:

- No sensitive action without auth.
- No sensitive action without permission.
- No mutation without audit.
- No file without storage metadata.
- No realtime event without standardized naming.
- No UI module that cannot later connect to real backend contracts.

## 9. Remaining Production Work

Before full city-scale production, the platform still needs:

- Complete backend data source wiring for every Office page.
- Real provider verification for Meta, LinkedIn, Google Ads/Analytics, WhatsApp, email, Twilio, device providers, and camera providers.
- Applied Supabase migrations in all production environments.
- Real Mapbox support if dual map providers are required.
- Full staff invite, photo upload, and email onboarding flow.
- Full document generation pipeline for proposals, contracts, invoices, letters, PDFs, and email sending.
- Full camera stream provider integration.
- Full Oyi AI voice/chat command execution with safe permissions.
- Full Digital Twin renderer and object binding.
- Full Plan Studio upload/analyze/generate pipeline.
- Load testing, rate limits, monitoring, backups, incident response, and production observability.

## 10. Naming

- Company/system layer: **Ochiga Infrastructure OS**.
- Product family: **Oyi OS**.
- Internal command center: **Ochiga Office OS**.
