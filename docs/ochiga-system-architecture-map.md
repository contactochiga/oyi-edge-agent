# Ochiga and Oyi System Architecture Map

Updated: 2026-05-16

## One-System View

Ochiga is the company and infrastructure technology layer.
Oyi is the operating system family that runs the estate, building, facility, resident, device, agent, and command workflows.
Ochiga Office is the internal corporate command system that supervises the whole ecosystem.

At full capacity, the combined system should be referred to as:

**Ochiga Infrastructure Operating System**

Internally, the product family can be organized as:

- **Ochiga Office OS**: internal command, governance, agents, staff, CRM, support, documents, reporting, integrations, and oversight.
- **Oyi Facility OS**: estate and facility manager control plane.
- **Oyi Consumer OS**: resident, home, and smart-building app surface.
- **Oyi Edge Agent**: on-site hardware, camera, gateway, discovery, health, and edge connectivity runtime.
- **Oyi Digital Twin**: live 3D building/estate operational twin layer.
- **Oyi Plan Studio**: plan upload, parsing, analysis, and design-to-operations tooling.
- **Oyi AI / Oyi Widget**: AI communication and command interface across websites, Office, and external deployments.
- **Ochiga Website**: corporate infrastructure narrative and deployment intake.
- **Oyi Website**: product narrative for the Oyi infrastructure operating system.

## 1. Oyi Consumer OS

### What It Is

Oyi Consumer OS is the resident, occupant, and smart-building app layer. It is the user-facing side of the Oyi ecosystem for people living in or using connected estates, homes, apartments, buildings, or communities.

It is described in the existing knowledge base as the resident and consumer-facing app prepared for mobile packaging, including iOS-style deployment.

### Primary Users

- Residents

  - Monthly: NGN 850,000
  - Premium estates and property groups.

### Relationship To The Rest Of The System

Oyi Facility OS is the estate operator source of truth.
It should sync estates, buildings, homes, devices, wallets, support cases, package plans, and usage state into Ochiga Office.
It connects operationally to Oyi Consumer OS, Oyi Edge Agent, Oyi Digital Twin, and Oyi AI.

### Current Production Readiness

Estimated production level: **65%**

Reason:
The operator UI and workflow coverage are strong, but billing persistence, invoicing, VAT, overages, payment rails, hardware imports, live estate sync into Office, and production-grade permission enforcement still need completion.

## 3. Ochiga Office OS

### What It Is

Ochiga Office OS is the internal corporate command center for the whole Ochiga business and product ecosystem.

It is not a public app. It is the internal mothership where Ochiga supervises products, estates, users, devices, staff, agents, commercial activity, support, documents, integrations, and operational governance.

It is where role-based authority, supervision, reporting, and escalation should live.

### Current Production Readiness

Estimated production level: **70%**

Reason:
The Office UI, backend routes, data contracts, maps, integrations status, staff/auth, and Oyi command layer exist and are deployed. The remaining gap is real external data sync, verified provider integrations, hardened permissions, storage, sockets, and complete production workflows.

## 4. Oyi Edge Agent

### What It Is

Oyi Edge Agent is the site-level runtime for local infrastructure connectivity.
It is the edge daemon that can run near cameras, gateways, devices, or estate hardware to register itself, send health, discover local systems, and sync with the cloud.

### Current Capabilities

### Primary Role

- Explain Oyi as the product/OS.
- Show estate, facility, resident, device, command, AI, and twin capabilities.
- Drive qualified demos/deployments.
- Feed leads into Oyi AI and Ochiga Office.

### Relationship To The Rest Of The System

The Oyi website is product-facing, while the Ochiga website is company-facing.
The Oyi website should send visitor activity, conversations, forms, and lead data into Ochiga Office CRM.

### Current Production Readiness

Estimated production level: **50%**

Reason:
The positioning exists, but the page needs cleanup, conversion alignment, stronger product architecture, and final widget/CRM integration.

## System Grouping

The cleanest grouping is:

### Public Layer

- Ochiga Website.
- Oyi Website.
- Oyi Widget.
- Deployment intake.

## Recommended Repository Organization

Do not move files blindly yet. The current repo is already production-linked to Vercel and Render.

Recommended future structure if this becomes a monorepo:

```text
ochiga-platform/
  apps/
    office/
    oyi-facility/
    oyi-consumer/
    ochiga-website/
    oyi-website/
    digital-twin/
    plan-studio/
  services/
    lead-agents-api/
    edge-agent/
    office-sync/
    integrations/
  packages/
    ui/
    auth/
    permissions/
    office-data-contracts/
    ai-agents/
    maps/
    documents/
    realtime/
  knowledge/
    company/
    product/
    sales/
    support/
    technical/
  infra/
    vercel/
    render/
    supabase/
    cloudflare/
```

Current practical approach:

- Keep `oyi-edge-agent` as Ochiga Office + Oyi AI + edge/backend runtime for now.
- Sync data from external Oyi Facility and Oyi Consumer repos instead of merging immediately.
- Create shared contracts before moving into a monorepo.
- Only migrate repos after production routing, envs, and deployment ownership are stable.

## Production Readiness Summary

| System | Current Production Level |
| --- | ---: |
| Ochiga Office OS | 70% |
| Oyi Facility OS | 65% |
| Oyi Consumer OS | 60% |
| Oyi Edge Agent | 55% |
| Oyi AI / Widget | 50% |
| Ochiga Website | 50% |
| Oyi Website | 50% |
| Oyi Plan Studio | 45% |
| Oyi Digital Twin | 40% |

Overall combined platform readiness: **55-60%**

This means the system is no longer conceptual. The main architecture, UI surfaces, backend routes, data contracts, and deployment pipeline exist. The remaining work is mainly production hardening, real integrations, data sync, permissions, storage, voice reliability, and cross-system automation.
